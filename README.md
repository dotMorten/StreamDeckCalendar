# StreamDeckCalendar
Shows the next calendar item from Windows Mail &amp; Calendar app in your stream deck


The background will change to yellow (15 mins), orange (10 mins) and red (5mins) when meeting is getting closer to start. The last minute it'll start flashing to remind you that it's almost time to join the meeting. Once the meeting has started, it'll be green.


Clicking the button will open the calendar details, but if there's less than 5 minutes until start and an online meeting URL is associated with it, it'll instead launch that URL.

# Configuration:

No configuration needed, except adding your calendar accounts to the Windows Mail & Calendar app.

# NOTE
The new Microsoft Outlook application that in the future will replace the Mail & Calendar app will _not_ work, since it is currently not using the Windows APIs to manage calendars.
